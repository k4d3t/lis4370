setwd(“~/R”)
assignment2 <- c(16,18,14,22,27,17,18,17,17,22,20,22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}
myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.16667

My evaluation of this function is that it accepts a value, then calculates the mean of the function by dividing the total of the data by the length of the data. This is similar to most mean functions.
